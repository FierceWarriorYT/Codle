# Codle 
We have all heard of Wordle. Although this game was the craze during COVID, some of the game's limitations can be addressed to create a more fulfilling experience for the user. Introducing, Codle, the new and improved version Wordle. Instead of having a fixed length string of 5 in wordle, Codle is different in the sense that each game with give you a string with a different length. For example, in the first game, you may have to guess the word "java" while in the second game the word to guess might be "inheritance." Additionally, all of the words are coding-related in order to create a learning component. Hope you enjoy :)
